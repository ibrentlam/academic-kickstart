This was also an excuse to learn the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). This site was edited in [vim](https://www.vim.org/), locally generated by [Hugo Server](https://gohugo.io/), pushed up to [github](https://github.com/), from there picked up by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). This site made by me, [Brent Laminack](https://laminack.com).
